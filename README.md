Hi!

As part of my Bloomberg Data Insight Week, in a group project, I was tasked with the responsibility to research how to clean and analyse M&A datasets so it can be shown visually with its geographical regions.
This involved learning more about what Data Professionals do and how the Bloomberg Terminal can help!

I wanted to have a bit of fun and made a full-stack website which should take in the provided M&A dataset given in the week, then clean and analyse it!

Here attached is the link to the website (although I'm using a Render cloud service free tier, so not only is it slow to load but it only have a month left to live...)
